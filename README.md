Concept of the Game:

This is a Text Adventure Game, based on choices and allowing
heavy personalization from the player.

The game takes into account the player's deaths, up to an amount
of 5 times, the 5th time being the final and last. The story
is affected by these deaths.

The game is NOT meant to be easy, but not too hard either.
The decisions must be based on logic and prevention, as tips
will be present here and there to aid the player, in the form
of the story. There is also a very small dose of RNG elements
present.
